            <div><p><b>1. Introduction</b><b /></p><p>These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the platform provided at Coinbyte.co (the “Platform”) and form a binding legal agreement between
            the customer (“you”, “your”) and Ausun Overseas Pty Ltd (ABN 54 637 345 290), operating under the business name “Coinbyte”&nbsp;(“we”, “us”, “our”).
            By accessing, using, or clicking “I agree”&nbsp;to any of the services made available by us,
            you agree that you have read, understood and accepted all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, as well as our <router-link to="#" onClick={this.openPolicy.bind(this)} className="text-primary">
                Privacy Policy
            </router-link> .</p><p><b>2. Amendments to these Terms</b><b /></p><p>These Terms may be amended at any stage without notice at our sole discretion and will be effective immediately upon their
            publication on the Platform. By continuing to use the Platform, you agree to the changes set out in these Terms. If you do not agree to any modification to these Terms,
            you should cease using the Platform immediately. We encourage you to review these Terms often to stay up to date with the current terms and conditions that apply to your use of
            the Platform.</p><p><b>3. Description of the Platform</b><b /></p><p>The Platform is provided by Ausun Overseas Pty Ltd exclusively to Australian residents and is not
            intended to be offered or made available to non-Australian residents. In order to access the Platform, you must place an order on Binance Australia, Huobi Global or OKex to buy digital
            currencies from us, and you must be an individual, sole trader, partnership, company that resides in, or is incorporated in, Australia.</p><p>
            The Platform enables you to transfer AUD into the account which is generated by the Platform. The provision of these services requires you
            to complete identity verification, otherwise known as a Know Your Customer (KYC) check, before the services can be provided to you.</p><p>All other aspects are not provided by the Platform, including all digital currency
            trading activity, accounts, and wallets, as well as the custody of your digital currency. </p><p>By using the Platform, you acknowledge that it is your responsible for the management of the assets after the purchase
            order is completed.</p><p><b>4. Risk of Purchasing Digital Currencies</b><b /></p><p>Digital currencies are a high risk asset which requires a heightened level of security precautions by the user. The digital currency market is generally more volatile than traditional financial markets and, as a market that operates 24/7, your assets are constantly appreciating or depreciating in value. This can result in significant gains to your assets, but also significant losses. Since the purchase of digital currency is not akin to purchasing other currencies, where a legal entity such as a government backs the currency, there is no legal entity that regulates digital currencies. Rather, digital currencies rely on blockchain technology to safeguard your assets and their movements. In the event of a crisis, there is no entity that will protect the digital currency market to minimise investor losses.</p><p>As Coinbyte does not custody the digital currencies which you purchase from us nor be able to identify the counterparty to any transactions you make, Coinbyte is not responsible or liable for any digital currencies once the purchase order is completed. Requesting a chargeback through your bank after a completed order is a fraudulent or illegal actions performed by you, you agree to be held liable for any losses that we suffer and agree to indemnify us for any reasonable costs, expenses and losses that are incurred as a result of any fraudulent or illegal actions performed by you intentionally or negligently.</p><p>Coinbyte is not responsible or liable for any digital currencies that have been sent to an incorrect or incompatible wallet address. Examples of incompatible wallet addresses include but are not limited to the type of digital currency being transferred or the Blockchain Network the digital currency is sent on.</p><p>Coinbyte recommends that you do not send digital currencies to any entities you do not personally know or completely trust, as, once sent, the transaction cannot be reversed. It is important for you to take precautions when transferring and storing your digital currencies through other sites, wallets or devices. We take no responsibility for the misappropriation or theft of your digital currencies. We strongly advise that you familiarise yourself with and implement a personal wallet service or other device for storing your digital currencies and implement other security measures. Always take a greater degree of care and precaution to secure your passwords when operating in a digital environment.</p><p>We are not an Australian Financial Services Licensee and nothing in these terms, the Platform, or any other material published or made available by us (whether in print or online) should not be taken as legal, taxation, or financial product advice. We encourage you to seek your own financial, legal, tax and accounting advice in relation to the purchase and sale of digital currencies.</p><p>You should analyse your risk preferences and financial situation carefully before purchasing digital currency.</p><p><b>5. Transfers AUD</b><b /></p><p>When you transfer AUD to us for the purchase order which you place, the bank account to which the AUD is being transferred from must be held in the same name as the account you have verified on Binance Australia, Huobi Global or OKex. </p><p>You are responsible for monitoring your account and the movements of any funds within your account to take appropriate actions in relation to deposits, withdrawals or other transactions that are incomplete, pending, have been cancelled or have lapsed, or have otherwise failed.</p><p>It is your responsibility to enter the correct BSB and account number for any AUD transfers made by you. Coinbyte does not, and will not check the details that you ente. If you enter incorrect bank details, it will not be our responsibility to recover those funds from the unintended recipient. Coinbyte is not liable for any loss or liability incurred by you as a result of any fiat currencies being sent to an unintended bank account.</p><p>During periods of increased market activity or volatility, we may be unable to complete your order. In these cases, any transfers may be refunded to the bank account from which the transfer was sent. We will not be liable for any fluctuations in price caused by market volatility, order, purchase or transfer delays, technical issues, or other issues that arise that are beyond our control.</p><p>If we reasonably believe that a transaction may be associated with fraud, money laundering or terrorism financing, or is suspected to be in breach of any other laws or any of the restrictions outlined in Section 8 of these Terms, or if there are technical reasons that prevent us from completing the transaction (including where any of the third party providers are unable to complete the transaction for any reason), we reserve the right to suspend, delay or cancel that transaction.</p><p><b>6.
